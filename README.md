Tranfering students from universities

As you recommended, I started only with registration.

Everything is in a single file name "index.html".

Everything includes : Images, Links, styles and tags.

*Explanation
-----------------------------------------------------

1. When you open the file, you are going to see a form where you insert the student's informations.

2. At the bottom, there are ID cards of students who are already in the system. (Name, image and K_number).

3. One thing I couldn't done was the image of a new student when registering. The browsers was giving me a "fake path" for security pusrposes. So, I used a predefined image.
